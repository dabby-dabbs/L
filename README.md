## Wiper Mechanism model Application using Matlab

In this project, I built an application using the rudimentary physics of a **4 bar linkage mechanism**(specifically Slider-Crank mechanism) to create a manipulatable simulation of a wiper mechanism to visualize its functional components and perform practical analysis using Matlab. In our case the wiper mechanism 
is a "bottom-middle pivoted synchronous dual arm wiper".


> ! To be able to run the demo through the app the user is first required to evaluate the model parameters which are required to conform to the 
>>**Grashof's Law**. (== evaluate before run)

The features of this project are :
1. GUI
2. SIMULATION
3. ERROR HANDLING
4. MODEL SAVE
5. PLOTS

We use the general metrics to generate the following plots of the model,

This project allowed me to experience the empirical process of full-scale product/model development.
